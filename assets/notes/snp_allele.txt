Hi. I viewed the heterozygous SNP in the hs_BC10 reads using IGV. It is at base 189 of the trimmed reference sequence. Based on the frequency of the two alleles, I infer that:
the SNP sequence at the mutant HTT allele is CGTCGGCGGGG G ATCCTTTCCG
the SNP sequence at the wildtype allele is CGTCGGCGGGG C ATCCTTTCCG.
 
Below is the information David included in the summary sheet. I have also attached an image from IGV.
